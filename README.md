# BitsOfGood2024
This is my submission for the Bits of Good Dev application. 
The zip file provided has all the code for the project. This should fulfill all the requirements up to the hard level!
To run, type the command node server.js into the terminal. Assuming all the dependencies are installed, and you are in the correct directory.

Thank you for your consideration,
Kevin Ghobrial
